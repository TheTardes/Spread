Project 2-Responsive design

As a group, we created a website in HTML and CSS based on a response to a reading we chose, "Hooked on a Feeling" by Micheal Rock.

The author primarily discusses how performance is shifting beyond rationality and how the moodboard represents feeling. He mentions that current brands are focusing more on the "allure" feeling side of the design, trying to give customers an emotional experience. Additionally, he talks about the importance of mood boards in creating such products and how they bring a sense of warmth and connection in a world overwhelmed by information.

As a response, we tried to jump on a trend, as Michael Rock emphasised, and create a website that evokes feelings while going through the main task of "reading an article." To reflect this, we designed a layout that focused on legibility and readability while evoking the mood board concept, giving the user an emotional experience. We added interactive buttons to enhance the website's dynamic feel, making it less like a static poster format and bringing the design to life.

We aimed to ensure an engaging experience across all devices through responsive design. Additionally, we developed a print-friendly layout to ensure the design is engaging and accessible both digitally and in print.
