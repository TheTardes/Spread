This is our Project 2 responsive design
Reading material - hooked on a feeling

Full Design and print verison is not done yet.

To do:
- We need to connect quotes with paragaph lines
- Switch toggle "on" to "off" with no color..
- Print version layout
- Figure out max and min width for mobile - delete margins from each block

10/29 Update:
Switch toggle can not be done in html&css, only in javascript.
