This is our Project 2 responsive design
The reading we choose is "hooked on a feeling" by Micheal Rock. The author primarily discusses about how performance is shifting beyond rationality, and how the moodboard represents feeling. We try to incorporate the moodboard concept into a formal grid based layout for legibility and readability. We also included interactive buttons to make the website feel more dynamic and less like a static poster.

Full Design and print verison is not done yet.

To do:
- We need to connect quotes with paragaph lines
- Switch toggle "on" to "off" with no color..
- Print version layout
- Figure out max and min width for mobile - delete margins from each block

10/29 Update:
Switch toggle can not be done in html&css, only in javascript.
5 screen size (phone×2, tablet, desktop×2),1 print
