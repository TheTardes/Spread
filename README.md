Project 2-Responsive design

As a group, we created a website in HTML and CSS based on the reading we chose "Hooked on a Feeling" by Micheal Rock.

The author primarily discusses about how performance is shifting beyond rationality, and how the moodboard represents feeling. 

To reflect this, we designed a  layout that emphasizes legibility and readability while evoking the moodboard concept. We added interactive buttons to enhance the website's dynamic feel, less like a static poster format and bringing the design to life.

Our aim was to ensure an engaging experience across all devices through responsive design. Additionally, we developed a print-friendly layout to ensure the design is engaging and accessible both digitally and in print.
